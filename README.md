### Quiz 8: Design Research

**Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**

**Chosen Imaging Technique:** Audio-Driven Interaction

**Explanation:** I chose the picture technique of combining audio and picture because our group decided to choose Piet Mondrian's 'Broadway Boogie Woogie' to work on for the Creative coding major project. I researched this piece of artwork. The painting uses the street network of Manhattan, New York and the rhythms of Boogie Woogie music as inspiration. It is composed of a series of coloured squares and straight lines, presenting an abstract, energetic and rhythmic art form.
Audio-driven interactive technology allows the graphic elements to respond to the rhythm and beat of the audio, creating a visual effect that is synchronised with the music. This matches the sense of movement and liveliness conveyed in Mondrian's work, injecting movement and energy into my project.

**Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration**

**Chosen Coding Technique:** Implementing Audio-Driven Interaction using JavaScript and Web Audio API

**Explanation:** To achieve audio-driven interaction, I will employ JavaScript in conjunction with the Web Audio API. The Web Audio API offers a comprehensive set of features for real-time audio processing. I will utilize it to capture the rhythm information of audio and apply it to the variation of image elements. By combining audio processing with graphic transformations in the code, I can create an artwork with a visual-auditory interaction.
